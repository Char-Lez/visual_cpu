# visual_cpu
A javascript based simulated CPU for educational purposes

The idea is simple, create a functional CPU simulator that can show how
the various parts of a real CPU and computer work.

The goal is to bridge the cognative gap between what people see on the screen,
type on the keyboard, and what the hardware actually does.

The CPU is loosly modeled on the 6502, and the Apple 2.

It has 64K RAM, which I believe is more than enough to learn the relationships.
