# visual_cpu
A javascript based simulated CPU for educational purposes

The idea is simple, create a functional CPU simulator that can show how
the various parts of a real CPU and computer work.

The goal is to bridge the cognative gap between what people see on the screen,
type on the keyboard, and what the hardware actually does.
